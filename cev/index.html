              <p class="lead">Why did i chose CEV in the first place?
                Well the answer is i didn't!
                My first choice was CET(thallassery),
                i wanted to have my current (old) friends from polytechnic college to be with me!
                so during LET i choose CET, but accidentally changed to CEV,
                all my friends were in cet and i was in CEV
                i hated myself for not being careful!
                but when the college started(online ofc) the students were so supportive and so easy to be with,i felt so comfortable with them.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                There was normally a awkward period when you meet someone new, well there wasn't here!
                I became so happy with my new experience with CEV i actually forgot about my other friends(i luv u guys)!
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                And through this event one thing i learned from CEV is that, people enjoy what they do!
                and all the post i went through to find something i smiled at least once!
                people dancing,cheering and the 
                <span class="mark">Quasso Liberum
                </span> is something I'm really looking forward to be a part in!
              <br>
              So far i met so many people through this event and im so happy for it even though we may not win
                <em>(fingers crossed)

              <p class="lead">When i was first come to this College I'm not that much happy because my friends are going to Job Mean while I was going to study for another three years!
                when the first Week of class It was extremely difficult for me I don't understand anything but after few weeks I was able to understand the topics because the faculties are here is extremely Good
                I was thankful for the student union because they were conducted such a great program.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">By participating this Program I got so many new friends and I was so grateful to get a chance to study here

              <p class="lead">I chose this college because near my home compared to other engineering colleges. I visit this college I liked it very well but I feel sad because my old friend s not with me.After few days online class is started, I think that select this college would be a great impact on my life being part of a class where I would learn so many things gave me the strength keep going it would give the chance to relate with new people and of course to meet new friends who could last for a lifetime.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">Teachers are putting a lot of effort into getting us things understand even in this pandemic situation and the classes are great!
                Overall I'm happy and grateful to be a part of CEV and looking forward to everything that would happen

              <p class="lead">In my heart, I'm not interested to study at this college just because it is near to my home. I've always wanted to study far away from college. 
                I have got a chance to meet my classmates. That moment completely changed my decision. 
              </p>
              <p class="lead">When that moment came I was so excited. I don't know how to explain that experience. Even though I do not like online classes, the teachers' effort and their hard work changed my feeling about it.
              <br>
              They are very friendly. I like the fact all the students have a good relationship with teachers. At any time we can contact our teachers. Because they gave that freedom.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">These factors are attractive to me and have been favorable to my decision to stay.<br>
